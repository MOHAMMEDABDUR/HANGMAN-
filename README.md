#HANGMAN




                   
The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game where a player tries to guess a hidden word one letter at a time. Each incorrect guess results in a part of a stick figure being drawn, representing the "hangman." The game ends when the word is guessed correctly or the hangman is fully drawn, indicating the player's loss.
